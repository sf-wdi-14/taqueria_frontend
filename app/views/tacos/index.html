<h1>Welcome to the taqueria!</h1>

<p>To complete this app, you are going to need... (among others)</p>

<ul>
	<li>Restful routes to crud tacos</li>
	<li>A view for each route</li>
	<li>A working clone of the <a href="https://github.com/sf-wdi-14/taqueria_backend" target="_blank">backend</a></li>
	<li>A Taco service that connects to our Rails backend at http://localhost:3000/tacos using $resource</li>
</ul>

<p>We prepared a TacosCtrl for you (you are looking at it right now).</p>
